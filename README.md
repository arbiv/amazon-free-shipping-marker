# Amazon Free Shipping Marker

This is a userscript that helps you identify items on Amazon that are eligible for free shipping to Israel. It works by adding a border around the product variant images. The border color indicates the shipping eligibility:

- Green border: The item is eligible for free shipping to Israel.
- Red border: The item is not eligible for free shipping to Israel.
- Grey border: The shipping information for the item could not be found.

## Installation

1. Install the Greasemonkey extension for Firefox. You can download it from the [Mozilla Add-ons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
2. Click on the Greasemonkey icon in your browser toolbar and select "New User Script...".
3. Copy and paste the script from `AmazonFreeShippingMarker.user.js` into the editor.
4. Save the script.

## Usage

Once the script is installed, it will automatically run whenever you visit a product page on Amazon. You don't need to do anything else.

## Compatibility

This script has been tested with Greasemonkey on Firefox. It may work with other userscript managers and browsers, but this is not guaranteed.
