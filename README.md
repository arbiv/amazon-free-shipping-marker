# Amazon Free Shipping Marker

This is a userscript that helps you identify items on Amazon that are eligible for free shipping to Israel. It works by adding a border around the product variant images. The border color indicates the shipping eligibility:

- Green border: The item is eligible for free shipping to Israel.
- Red border: The item is not eligible for free shipping to Israel.
- Grey border: The shipping information for the item could not be found.
